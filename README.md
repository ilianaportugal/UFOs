# UFOs

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to create a website that allows page visitors to filter a table using multiple criteria (date, city, state, country and shape). The table offers data on UFO sightings and is fully dynamic, responding to user input.

## Results
A user is prompted to enter values in the fiter section which contain placeholders. There are five values a user can choose to enter: date, city, state, country and shape. 

## Summary
A drawback of this current design is that the value written in the filter box needs to match exactly a value in the table data. Individuals visiting this page might type a value incorrectly, for example, typing California as 'CA' rather than 'ca'

### Recommendation #1
One recommendation to improve the design is to have a list of options to choose from in each filter box. 

### Recommendation #2
A second recommendation is to change the code in javascript from an 'exact' match to a 'loose' match.
